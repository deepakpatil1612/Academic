Hi, I am Deepak Patil, I am a Professor in Department of Civil Engineering, KLE College of Engineering and Technology, Chikodi (Affilated to VTU, Belagavi). I teach Structural Engineering subjects. Also i am very much keeen in few open source programming languages like Scientific Python, OpenSees etc.. I feel, there is a strong need to change the conventional style of chalk and talk and we should bring the technology into the classroom. This blog is created with a intention of digitizing the classroom, my students should be able to access the academic material from any corner of the world at any time. I have also tried to inject some of my professional activities in this blog.
