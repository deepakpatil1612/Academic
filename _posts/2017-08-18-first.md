## Hi, this is my first post on my blog....

  As i have already declared that this is my first blog on my website, so if any mistakes, if any unusual things.. please ignore them.
  
  Now coming to the main agenda of this article is *Useful websites and blogs for Civil Engineering Students*. Now while i was going through Internet, i found following websites and blogs useful for Civil Engineering students.
  
1. [colincaprani](http://www.colincaprani.com/) This is a blog created by a professor of Structural Engineering(for details about the author of the blog, you can visit his blog). In his blog he has uploaded his lecture notes on almost all the topics of Structural Engineering. Also he has showcased some of his programming works. Do visit his site.
  
2. [ce.memphis.edu](http://www.ce.memphis.edu/3121/notes/notes.html) This is a Civil Engineering course website created on Structural Engineering topic.
  
3. [structural-analyser](http://structural-analyser.com/#tab_view_1m) I found this very useful in my teaching career. This is actually a web based app for analysis of beams (like finding reactions, drawing Shear and Moment diagrams etc..). The advantage of this is, it does not require any installation of software, it can be directly used in your browser. Also it can be used in your mobile phone browsers too.
  
4. [MaFoDeM](http://mafodem.kitnarf.cz) A matrix based structural analysis software- free to use...
  
5. [learnaboutstructures](http://www.learnaboutstructures.com) Once again a course website on Structural Engineering. Here the author has explained the concepts of Structural analysis in detail. Explanation is very easy to understand.
  
6. [Structurefree](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-5QQuejPrfzryw1NDsS6zg) YouTube channel dedicated to Structural Engineering subjects. Well explained concepts can be found here. I use it most often.
  
7. [Chris Chang](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa095k72tgjY2PCOxe8sdJg) Again a YouTube channel dedicated on Structural analysis concepts. It has helped me a lot in my teaching career.
  
8. [Dr. Structure](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvSpLnUTU6MamZwD2a9zySg) You-Tube channel explaining the concepts of Structural Engineering. Way of presentation is very pleasing to the audience.

9. [Seeing and Touching Structural Concepts](http://www.mace.manchester.ac.uk/project/teaching/civil/structuralconcepts/Introduction/background.php) Here few of the structural concepts...oops i must say most of the structural concepts like equillibrium, statics, dynamics etc.. are well explained. Along with this they have also given the idea to meodel these concepts. This is an interesting website for UG students.
